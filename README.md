### Description

This is a sample program on how to Scan / Twain Acquire an image from a scanner into your VB Program. I wanted to know every call to the TWAIN32 dll file(s). I have looked and found some great custom Twain Code that has heeeeps of features, but it is bundled in C++. This program that I Have written can scan / Acquire an Image from a Scanner. I have also included every single call to the dll file just incase you want to &#8216;Extend&#8217; this program. There are other examples on PSC, they were a great help to me, but they didn&#8217;t have Every call to the C++ dll.
